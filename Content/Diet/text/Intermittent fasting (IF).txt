Intermittent fasting is a dietary strategy that cycles between periods of fasting and eating.

Intermittent fasting is not considered a diet in the conventional sense but is accurately described as a dietary pattern. Currently, there is a variety of ways to implement this eating pattern.

-Types of fasting plan: Fasting involves allocating the times of fasting and eating by day or week. During the fast, you may eat very little or nothing. You can check out some of the most common intermittent fasting options below:
.16/8 method: This method related to skipping breakfast and limit eating time down to 8 hours, for example from 1pm to 9pm. After that, you will fast 16 hours.
.Eat-Stop-Eat: This eating pattern involves fasting 24 hours, once or twice a week. For instance, you will fast for 1 day until evening the next day.
.The 5:2 Diet: In this pattern of eating, you only consume 500-600 calories on 2 days a week (not 2 consecutive days), while the other 5 days eat as usual.

-Weight loss: Studies showed that intermittent fasting was shown to cause 3–8% weight loss over 3–24 weeks, which is a significantly greater percentage than other methods.

-Other benefits: Intermittent fasting has been linked to anti-aging effects, increased insulin sensitivity, improved brain health, reduced inflammation, and many other benefits.

-Disadvantages: Downsides: In general, intermittent fasting is safe for most healthy adults.
However, those sensitive to drops in their blood sugar levels, such as people with diabetes, low weight, or an eating disorder, as well as pregnant or breastfeeding women, should talk to a health professional before starting intermittent fasting.
