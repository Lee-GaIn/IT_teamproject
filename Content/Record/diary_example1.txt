My diet always consists of  100g of vegetable, protein and carbohydrate. The proteins including my diet were tofu, eggs and chicken breast and most carbohydrates were sweet potatoes, pumpkin and some bread. However, I overate today and do not follow my plan because I broke up with my lovers so I cannot focus on my works. I feel sad, depressed, heartbroken and sorrowful. I ate sugar-free yoghurt between 4:00 pm and 5:00 pm but it does not help my feelings. Today was bad day in my life.
