Today was a great day. I feel happy, happy, happy and happy. I can follow my diet and I enjoy my exercise plan. Swimming is still difficult for me but I want to try more and more because I love it when I look at myself wearing swimming suits. Someone thinks it is ridiculous motivation however I don't care about that. I am glad about my weight now. I gained 5 pounds and it helps me to focus on daily works. I feel cheerful. I LOVE my life.
