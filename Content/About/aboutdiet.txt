What is diet?
Diet is a nutritional concept that refers to the total amount of food consumed by an organism (usually humans and animals) to meet the needs of survival and development. The word diet often implies the use of specific nutrients for health or weight management reasons (with two factors involved). Although humans are carnivores, each culture and each person holds some different preferences in eating. This could be due to personal tastes or ethical reasons (the morality of eating meat). Diet choices can be more or less healthy.
